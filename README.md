# Uturn
Identifying DNA U-turn from whole-genome sequencing reads. The DNA U-turn is a special DNA structure that aligns across postivie and negative strands. This project mainly uses two-step mapping approach to find this structure in next generation sequencing data.

# Prerequisition
The pipeline prerequisition includes bowtie2, gawk and SE-MEI (extractSoftclippedRetain) in PATH.
## Instructions of compile SE-MEI
download SE-MEI source code from Devon Ryan's repository

  `git clone --recursive https://github.com/dpryan79/SE-MEI.git`
